## 🔒 Verifying APK Checksums (SHA-256)

If you want to verify that your downloaded APK is genuine and untampered, you can check its SHA-256 hash against the `checksums.txt` file attached to each release:

* **Linux / Mac Terminal:**
  ```bash
  sha256sum secure-dialer-v1.5.0-arm64-v8a.apk
  ```
* **Windows PowerShell:**
  ```powershell
  Get-FileHash .\secure-dialer-v1.5.0-arm64-v8a.apk -Algorithm SHA256
  ```

## 🛠️ Quick Troubleshooting Tips

* **"App Not Installed" Error:** If you previously had a debug build or older version signed with a different key, uninstall it first before installing the official release APK.
* **"Blocked by Play Protect" Warning:** Since the app is downloaded from GitHub and not the Play Store, tap **More Details -> Install Anyway**. Secure Dialer is 100% open source and contains zero network or tracking code.
* **"Unknown Apps" Prompt:** When downloading via browser or Obtainium, make sure you allow "Install Unknown Apps" in your device's system settings.
