# Changelog

All notable changes, fixes, and release milestones for Secure Dialer are documented here.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-28

### Outgoing Caller ID (CLIR) Privacy
- **Outgoing Number Masking (CLIR)**: Added a master toggle to withhold Caller ID on outgoing calls so recipients see Private/Unknown number.
- **Carrier Standards & Custom Prefix**: Built-in support for global carrier prefixes including `#31#` (GSM standard), `*67` (US & Canada), `141` (UK), `1831` (Japan), and full custom prefix input.
- **Hardware SIM Settings Direct Shortcut**: Added a direct launcher button to open Android's native SIM Calling Accounts screen for hardware-level carrier caller ID configuration.
- **Emergency Number Safety Guarantee**: Automated bypass protocol ensures emergency service calls (`911`, `112`, `999`, etc.) are never prepended with carrier codes and always broadcast subscriber telemetry to first responders.

### Call Recording Engine Hardening
- **Idempotent Recording Lifecycle**: Implemented atomic state tracking (`AtomicBoolean`) preventing race condition crashes between UI disposal and telephony teardown.
- **Decoupled Database Persistence**: Decoupled Room database insertion from `InCallService` lifecycle, ensuring finished recordings are 100% saved even after rapid call teardown.
- **Safe Container Finalization**: Added graceful MediaRecorder buffer flushes before storage auto-deletion checks to prevent ghost or truncated recordings.
- **Self-Healing Storage Recovery**: Opening Call Recordings settings automatically discovers and indexes any orphaned `.m4a` files on disk with zero data loss.
- **Runtime Audio Permission Flow**: Explicit Android microphone permission orchestration with non-intrusive user prompts.

### Architecture & APK Splits
- **Multi-ABI APK Splits**: Added architecture-specific splits (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, and universal) to keep download sizes tiny, fast to install, and optimized for different phone processors.

### Navigation & Back-Gesture Polish
- **Predictive System Back Support**: Added Compose `BackHandler` hooks across active calls, call log details, and settings sub-menus so swiping back navigates cleanly step-by-step without accidentally closing the app.

### Button Contrast & Dynamic Theming
- **High-Contrast Call Controls**: Redesigned calling and call-answer buttons in a clean, recognizable green, and hang-up / decline buttons in a crisp red.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added
